figure out why only sometimes a crash happens when in lava (most likely due to renderer trying to figure out what is visible and it shits itself when you're inside of a block)

make fall damage use a actual formula instead of just checking for velocity

add gui stuff for gamerules

difficulty (speedrunning hardcore would be fun on this)

multiplayer (fuck this, i've spent 2 fucking days trying to get a socket working on it and nothing)

mobs

sound and music (it softlocks completely for some reason when the file finishes playing, guessing the thread needs to be closed or something)

fire

sort textures into a more minecraft way (resource and data packs?)

lighting

make doors actually work

gates and fences

food

hud stuff for hp

day night cycle

weather

stats like how many kills, time survived and player deaths

tnt

dimensions

crafting (probs using json for crafting stuff)

furnace

ores

potions

projectiles

liquids (half done, now need to make them spread)

block hardness and explosion resistance

redstone

items

weapons

armour

menu when you die (maybe cause of death as well)

add beds (bed bombs?)

add thing to enable cheats/commands in a world

inventory

animated textures

transparent textures

any help would be appreciated here
