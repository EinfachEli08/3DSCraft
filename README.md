## History

It's been a while since I started developing this version of Craftus. I started to do a rewrite, because the old Craftus was beyond fixable. Probably 15% is copied from the old Craftus the remaining part is rewritten.

## Features

* An infinte world(in theory)
* Two different world generators
* Blocks, of multiple variants, can be broken and placed down to build structures
* A basic inventory system
* Saving and loading, multiple worlds
* Clouds and menus
* Sneaking and Flying

## Default Controls

_The controls can be changed by editing the file which can be found at `sd:/craftus/options.ini` (instructions can be found there too)._

## Known bugs

* ~~I experienced once, that blocks, which are newly placed in a specific chunk weren't rendered anymore, but blocks placed in another chunk were, but I couldn't reproduce this bug. Maybe it's related to old savefiles~~ I hope I fixed this bug, because I couldn't find a way to reproduce it.
* ~~Making a screenshot with Luma Rosalina menu leads to crash~~ Somehow this doesn't happen anymore
