Custom version of craftus that intends to clone minecraft 1.16.5

Releases aren't going to be too common (hrr drr, changed a variable name, make a release just for it)

To build from source, it's like building any other 3ds homebrew app. Just run make and if you've got devkitpro setup right, it'll give you craftus.3dsx

You'll need a hacked system that can load homebrew for this to run (citra is good for testing but i haven't been able to get most of the controls working there)


Craftus Redisigned is a modified version of Craftus Reloaded : https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded.


After launching it for the first time, you can change the controls in `sd:/craftus_redesigned/options.ini`.
You can also change the settings in `sd:/craftus_redesigned/options.ini`.
