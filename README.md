# 3DSCraft
Yet another revival of craftus, updating to more recent behavior and rebrandings.

## Building
- Install Devkitpro
- run make, read the errors properly.
- Get 3DSCraft.cia/.3dsx :)

You'll need a hacked system that can load homebrew for this to run (citra is good for testing but i haven't been able to get most of the controls working there)


This was forked from Onixiya/craftus: https://github.com/Onixiya/craftus


After launching it for the first time, you can change the controls in `sd:/3dscraft/options.ini`.
You can also change the settings in `sd:/3dscraft/options.ini`.
